## Validation Snapshot

```text
git status -sb at v7.236 start: clean
git rev-parse HEAD at v7.236 start: bd73eb5
git rev-parse origin/master at v7.236 start: bd73eb5
agent_board_freshness: manually checked from exact diff
git diff --check: passed
rule_intake_smoke_test: passed in v7.224b read-only smoke test
scripts/validate_mvp.ps1: not required for board-only calibration unless reviewer escalates
scripts/validate-agent-image-lab-local.ps1: not required for board-only calibration unless reviewer escalates
node scripts/validate_runtime_prototype_suite.js: not required; no runtime prototype changed
```

## Boundary Confirmation

```text
real VCPChat read: no
real VCPToolBox read: no
real manifest read: no
plugin call: no
API call: no
DailyNote call: no
VCP memory write: no
image creation: no
runtime execution: no
external repository modification: no
dependency/config/env modification: no
```

## Human Decisions Needed

```text
No human decision is needed to finish v7.236 commit and guarded push because the user authorized safe A4 docs-only autopilot and standing guarded push authorization is active.
Human authorization is needed before any A5 provider contact, runtime integration, tag/release/deploy, or repetitive low-value A4 gate.
```

## Exact Resume Prompt

不要读取真实 VCPChat/VCPToolBox。
不要读取真实 manifest。
不要调用插件/API/DailyNote/VCP memory。
不要创建图片。
不要进入 runtime/A5/release/tag，除非已有明确授权且 preflight 通过。
不要继续新增 Smart Commander 调教 gate，除非 review 证明必要。
不要编辑文件，直到 Autopilot Rule Intake 完成并复述 hard stops、no git add .、exact-file staging 和 agent_board update rule。
