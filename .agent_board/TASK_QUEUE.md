# TASK_QUEUE.md — Agent Image Lab Sustained Autopilot

Persistent task queue for guarded local work.

This board does not authorize external reads, VCPToolBox/VCPChat changes, plugin calls, DailyNote writes, API calls, image creation, VCP memory writes, pushes, tags, releases, dependency changes, destructive commands, or writes outside the workspace root.

## Current Mission

```text
Complete v7.230 prompt package A5 authorization handoff gate and route the next phase to review console asset status taxonomy.
```

---

## Current Mode

```text
A4.5 — Smart Local Autopilot under A4 — Sustained Local Autopilot boundaries
Single-Window 4-Agent Compact Autopilot
```

- real VCPToolBox read without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- real manifest read without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- config/env/log/secret read
- raw source copy from external repositories
- IPC / preload / renderer implementation in VCPChat
- executable Adapter implementation
- plugin/API/DailyNote call without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- image file creation without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
