# TASK_QUEUE.md — Agent Image Lab Sustained Autopilot

Persistent task queue for guarded local work.

This board does not authorize external reads, VCPToolBox/VCPChat changes, plugin calls, DailyNote writes, API calls, image creation, VCP memory writes, pushes, tags, releases, dependency changes, destructive commands, or writes outside the workspace root.

---

## Current Mission

```text
Use the calibrated .agent_board after v7.221 mainline quality stop to choose the next value-bearing project task.
```

---

## Current Mode

```text
A4.5 — Smart Local Autopilot under A4 — Sustained Local Autopilot boundaries
Single-Window 4-Agent Compact Autopilot
```

---

## Hard Stop Gates

Stop before:

- real VCPChat read without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- real VCPToolBox read without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- real manifest read without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- config/env/log/secret read
- raw source copy from external repositories
- IPC / preload / renderer implementation in VCPChat
- executable Adapter implementation
- plugin/API/DailyNote call without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- image file creation without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- VCP memory write without a concrete active authorization package and passing preflight
- push / PR / merge / tag / release without a concrete active version-action package, standing authorization, and passing preflight
- dependency change without a concrete active dependency-change package and passing preflight
- write outside workspace root without a concrete active external-write package and passing preflight
- A5 production action without an active authorization package and passing preflight

```text
production actions remain blocked
active authorization package required for A5
```

## Queue

### in_progress

```text
none
```

### todo

```text
1. Commander: run next-task value test against current README/ROADMAP/docs when continuing.
2. Commander: stop before A5 provider contact, runtime integration, tag/release, or repetitive A4 work unless explicit authorization or clear new value exists.
```

### next_candidates_after_calibration

```text
1. provider fingerprint A5 activation package — requires explicit A5 provider-contact authorization; not automatic.
2. Review Console runtime integration package — requires explicit runtime authorization; not automatic.
3. tag/release readiness action — requires explicit version-action authorization; not automatic.
4. new A4 docs/static task — allowed only if commander value test proves a non-redundant product gap.
```

### done

```text
1. v7.187-v7.203 Smart Commander protocol track consolidated and made portable.
2. v7.205-v7.213 Static Review Console mockup track reached quality stop.
3. v7.214-v7.221 mainline/provider/release readiness reviews reached quality stop.
4. Validator Governance Chain v1: closed.
5. batch_005_allowed_now: false.
6. production_candidate_002_allowed_now: false.
7. memory_write_path_allowed_now: false.
8. .agent_board current-state calibration content updated.
9. git diff --check passed.
10. node scripts/validate_agent_board_state.js passed.
11. guarded push preflight passed.
12. board calibration pushed to origin/master.
```

### blocked

```text
1. A5 provider contact is blocked until explicit matching authorization.
2. Runtime integration is blocked until explicit matching authorization.
3. Tag/release is blocked until explicit matching authorization and preflight.
4. Repetitive A4 docs-only gates are blocked unless they create new product value.
```
