# RUN_STATE.md — Agent Image Lab

## Current Mode

```text
A4.5 — Smart Local Autopilot under A4 — Sustained Local Autopilot boundaries
```

## Current Mission

```text
Agent Image Lab has run active A5 preflight only for the product image authorization draft. The result is blocked by dirty worktree; no activation or execution is allowed.
```

## Current Phase

```text
Active A5 Preflight Only — Product Image Authorization Draft
status: blocked_dirty_worktree
source_commit: 03fd398
source_message: docs: add product image generation plan draft
branch: master tracking origin/master
Worktree: dirty from v7.240-v7.243 local A4.5 chain and the active preflight record
worktree_start_clean: true
origin_sync_start: local HEAD equals origin/master at 03fd398
```

## Current Task

```text
Run local preflight against AUTH-PENDING-20260512-001 without entering active A5, runtime, provider contact, plugin call, image generation, DailyNote write, output save, or VCP memory write.
```

## Current Local Work State

```text
Worktree: dirty with current A4.5 local docs/validator chain; active A5 preflight is blocked_dirty_worktree
active_workers: 0
execution_mode: Single-Window 4-Agent Compact Autopilot
commander_role: complete docs-only non-active skeleton and stop before human-only activation fields
architect_role: keep write scope to docs, indexes, and .agent_board current-state files
worker_role: apply the skeleton and board patch only
reviewer_role: inspect diff, run allowed local checks, and close out
```

## Next Action

```text
Use the calibrated board as the current navigation source.
Active A5 preflight was run locally and is blocked by dirty worktree. Generation remains blocked until the worktree is made safe or explicitly checkpointed, preflight is rerun and passes, and a separate execution decision is made.
Before continuing, verify branch, worktree, local/remote sync, and explicit authorization scope from Git/user output.
```
