# RUN_STATE.md — Agent Image Lab

## Current Mode

```text
A4.5 — Smart Local Autopilot under A4 — Sustained Local Autopilot boundaries
```

## Current Mission

```text
Agent Image Lab is in v7.226 image workflow product return gate. The goal is to stop governance polishing and choose the next value-bearing image workflow product task.
```

## Current Phase

```text
v7.226 — Image Workflow Product Return Gate
status: completed_validated
source_commit: cbe3fc6
source_message: docs: add codex worker verifier contract
branch: master tracking origin/master
Worktree: clean at v7.226 start
worktree_start_clean: true
origin_sync_start: local HEAD equals origin/master at cbe3fc6
```

## Current Task

```text
Evaluate the image workflow chain and select the highest-value next A4 product-mainline task without entering A5, runtime, provider contact, plugin call, image generation, or memory write.
```

## Current Local Work State

```text
Worktree: clean at v7.226 start; product return plan completed_validated
active_workers: 0
execution_mode: Single-Window 4-Agent Compact Autopilot
commander_role: calibrate state and decide whether there is a next valuable task
architect_role: keep write scope to .agent_board current-state files
worker_role: apply the board patch only
reviewer_role: inspect diff, run allowed local checks, and close out
```

## Latest Mainline Status

```text
Smart Commander protocol track: consolidated and no longer the default next track
Static Review Console mockup track: quality stop reached
v10.12 provider fingerprint preparation: complete but inactive
Release readiness delta: quality stop reached
Board calibration: v7.222 completed and pushed
Value selection: v7.223 selected v7.224 as the only safe next task
Status freshness alignment: v7.224 completed and pushed
Autopilot intake hardening: v7.224a pushed; v7.224b read-only smoke test passed
Balanced codex exec role contracts: v7.225 completed_validated
Image workflow product return: v7.226 completed_validated
Recommended unique route: prompt_package_builder
New A4 docs-only gate: allowed only if it creates a new decision, boundary, or product value
Default continue_A4_docs_only_by_default: false
```

## Current Options

```text
recommended_next_after_v7_226: v7.227_prompt_package_builder_taskbook_gate
purpose: define the product image Prompt Package Builder taskbook/schema/handoff before any generation authorization
not_allowed_as_next_by_default: A5, provider contact, runtime, plugin call, image generation, memory write, tag, release

## Next Action

```text
Use the calibrated board as the current navigation source.
v7.226 selected Prompt Package Builder as the next product-mainline route. Continue only with v7.227_prompt_package_builder_taskbook_gate or a user-approved alternative.
Before continuing after v7.226, verify branch, worktree, and local/remote sync from Git output.
