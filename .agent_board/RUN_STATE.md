## Current Task

```text
Create a synthetic non-executing product workflow fixture packet that connects prompt package, review record, memory suitability, and delivery handoff.
```

## Current Local Work State

```text
Worktree: clean at v7.258 start after v7.257 push
active_workers: 0
execution_mode: Single-Window 4-Agent Compact Autopilot
commander_role: keep Route 3 product-mainline progress inside static Review Surface boundaries
architect_role: connect existing paper artifacts into one synthetic fixture without execution
worker_role: apply only the fixture packet records, indexes, validator, and .agent_board patch
reviewer_role: inspect diff, run allowed local checks, confirm no runtime/provider/plugin/image/memory behavior, and close out
```

## Boundary Confirmation

```text
real VCPChat read: no
real VCPToolBox read: limited authorized DoubaoGen execution surface only
real manifest read: no
plugin call: yes, two authorized diagnostic retries total
API/provider contact: yes, via authorized DoubaoGen diagnostic retries
DailyNote call: no
VCP memory write: no
image file created: no
runtime execution: yes, authorized child processes only
dependency/config/env change: no
external repository modification: no
```

## Next Action

```text
Use the calibrated board as the current navigation source.
The second newly approved DoubaoGen diagnostic retry was consumed by one process attempt. The result is failed_no_image_repeated_quota_or_rate_limit; generation remains blocked unless the user resolves provider quota/rate-limit conditions or authorizes a new provider/model/account path.
For Route 3 product-mainline work, continue only with paper/static artifacts that do not enter A5, provider contact, plugin call, image generation, runtime, or memory write. The current recommended next is v7.259_product_workflow_fixture_packet_acceptance_review_gate.
```
