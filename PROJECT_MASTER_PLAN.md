# Agent Image Lab Project Master Plan

Purpose: short index for current project direction. This file is not the only
source of truth. Detailed history and operating authority remain in `README.md`,
`docs/00_project_roadmap.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.agent_board/`.

## Current Baseline

```text
branch: master
source_head_before_v7_236: bd73eb5
origin_master_at_v7_236_start: bd73eb5
status: v7.236 product image workflow A5 readiness review gate
mode: A4 docs-only readiness review
```

## Product Direction

Agent Image Lab remains a VCP-native visual production orchestration layer.
The product mainline has returned to image workflow planning. The Prompt Package
Builder now defines the first controllable artifact before generation
authorization or provider contact: a reviewable product image prompt package.
v7.228 adds the fillable instance template for that package without creating a
real generation task. v7.229 adds the human review checklist and status taxonomy
that decide whether a package may be referenced by a future A5 authorization
draft. v7.230 adds the non-executing handoff template from approved package to
future A5 authorization draft inputs. v7.231 defines the future generated asset
status taxonomy and review surface fields. v7.232 defines the non-writing
memory suitability decision matrix. v7.233 links these artifacts into a single
Delivery / Review Surface Package. v7.234 turns the chain into an operator
runbook. v7.235 validates the chain with a synthetic matte ceramic coffee mug
walkthrough. v7.236 confirms the chain is ready for a non-active A5
authorization draft, not active execution.

## Active Boundaries

```text
A5: not authorized
provider contact: not authorized
runtime execution: not authorized
plugin call: not authorized
image generation: not authorized
DailyNote / VCP memory write: not authorized
real manifest / VCPChat / VCPToolBox read: not authorized
tag / release / deploy / push: not authorized by this file
```

## Operating Model

Use one persistent commander as the source of judgment. Use temporary
`codex exec` Workers only for exact task contracts. Use read-only Verifiers only
for evidence review. The commander remains responsible for final scope review,
validation interpretation, staging, commit decisions, and next-task selection.

## Recommended Next

Proceed to `v7.237_product_image_generation_authorization_draft_gate`. Create
a non-active A5 authorization draft from the reviewed chain. Do not activate
A5, contact providers, call plugins, generate images, save output, or write
memory.
